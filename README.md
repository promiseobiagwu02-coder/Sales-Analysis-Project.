### Data Cleaning/Preparation.

The raw retail sales dataset was cleaned and prepared using Power Query to ensure accuracy, consistency and readiness for analysis. We performed the folling task:
1. Imported and validated data to confirm correct data types for dates, numeric values, and text fields.
2. Handled missing values by removing incomplete records and correcting null entries where appropriate.
3. Standardized categorical fields such as product categories, regions, and customer gender to eliminate inconsistencies.

Created derived columns including:
- Total Revenue (Unit Price × Quantity)
- Year, Month, and Day extracted from transaction dates.
- Weekday vs Weekend classification.
- Customer age groups for demographic analysis.
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to reduce noise and improve model performance.
